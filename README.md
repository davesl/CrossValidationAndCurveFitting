# CrossValidationAndCurveFitting

Simple matlab tools for k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation. A set of simple models (orginally used to describe brain aging) are included as examples for model comparison. Alternative models can be constructed for use in cross-validation by creating customised model functions which preserve the INPUT/OUTPUT characteristics of the example models.
